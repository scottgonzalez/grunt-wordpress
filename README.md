# grunt-wordpress

Grunt plugin for publishing content to WordPress

## Getting Started
Install this grunt plugin next to your project's
[grunt.js gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md)
with: `npm install grunt-wordpress`

Then add this line to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-wordpress" );
```

## API

For most projects, you should only need to specify the `wordpress` config
and use the `wordpress-deploy` task (or its alias `deploy`).

### Config

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
	wordpress: {
		url: "wordpress.dev",
		username: "admin",
		password: "admin",
		dir: "dist"
	}
});
```

This works for a single deployment target. If you have multiple targets, you
can specify url, username and password for each:

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
	wordpress: {
		dev: {
			url: "wordpress.dev",
			username: "admin",
			password: "admin",
		},
		live: {
			url: "wordpress.com",
			username: "admin",
			password: "admin",
		},
		_default: "dev",
		dir: "dist"
	}
});
```

If nothing is specified, the _default target is used. Override using the
target task:

	grunt target:live deploy

* `url`: The URL for the WordPress install.
  Can be a full URL, e.g., `http://wordpress.dev:123/some/path`
  or as short as just the host name.
  If the protocol is `https`, then a secure connection will be used.
* `username`: WordPress username.
* `password`: WordPress password.
* `dir`: Directory containing posts, taxonomies, and resources (see [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)).
* `_default`: The deployment target, optional.

### Directory Structure

The `wordpress.dir` directory has the following structure:

```
dir
├── posts
│   └── <post_type>
│       └── <post_name>.html
├── resources
│   └── <file>.<ext>
└── taxonomies.json
```

The `posts` directory must only contain `<post_type>` directories.
The `<post_type>` directories must be named to exactly match a post type, e.g., `post` or `page`.
All custom post types are supported.

The `resources` directory is completely freeform.
Resources of any type will be uploaded based on the current directory structure.

### taxonomies.json

The `taxonomies.json` file defines all used taxonomy terms.
You can only manage terms, all taxonomies much already exist in WordPress.

```json
{
	"<taxonomy_name>": [
		{
			"name": "My Term",
			"description": "My term is awesome",
			"slug": "my-term"
		},
		{
			"name": "My Other Term",
			"slug": "my-other-term",
			"children": [
				{
					"name": "I'm a child term!",
					"slug": "hooray-for-children"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

Slugs and names are required.

### Post Files

Post files must be HTML, containing the content of the post.
Post data can be specified as JSON in a `<script>` element at the top of the file.

```html
<script>{
	"title": "My Post",
	"termSlugs": {
		"<taxonomy_name>": [
			"<hierarchical_slug>"
		]
	}
}</script>
<p>I'm a post!</p>
```

The post type and parent are determined based on the [directory structure](#directory-structure).
`termSlugs` must match a hierarchical slug defined in [taxonomies.json](#taxonomiesjson).

### Tasks

#### wordpress-validate

Walks through the `wordpress.dir` directory and performs various validations, such as:

* Verifying that XML-RPC is enabled for the WordPress site.
* Verifying that the custom XML-RPC methods for grunt-wordpress are installed.
* Verifying the taxonomies and terms in `taxonomies.json`.
* Verifying that child-parent relationships for posts are valid.
* Verifying data for each post.

#### wordpress-sync

Synchronizes everything in `wordpress.dir` to the WordPress site.
This will create/edit/delete terms, posts, and resources.

*Note: `wordpress-validate` must run prior to `wordpress-sync`.*

#### wordpress-publish

Alias task for `wordpress-validate` and `wordpress-sync`.
This is useful if your original source content is already in the proper format,
or if you want to manually verify generated content between your custom build and publishing.

#### wordpress-deploy

Alias task for `build-wordpress` and `wordpress-publish`.
This is useful if you are generating content for use with `wordpess-sync`.
Simply create a `build-wordpress` task that populates the `wordpress.dir` directory
and your deployments will be as simple as `grunt wordpress-deploy`.

#### deploy

Alias task for `wordpress-deploy`.
Since most projects that use grunt-wordpress only have one deploy target (WordPress),
there is a built-in `deploy` task that just runs `wordpress-deploy`.
If your project has multiple deploy targets, you can simply re-alias the `deploy` task.

### Helpers

#### wordpress-recurse( path, callback, complete )

Walks through all files in `path` (asynchronous and in series ).

* `path`: The directory to walk through.
* `callbak` (`function( filepath, callback )`): Callback to invoke for each file.
  * `filepath`: Path to the current file.
  * `callback`: A callback to invoke after processing the file.
  Passing an error will stop the helper.
* `complete`: (`function( error )`): Callback to invoke after walking all files.

#### wordpress-client()

Gets a client for connecting to the WordPress site via XML-RPC.

#### wordpress-validate-xmlrpc-version( callback )

Verifies that the XML-RPC extensions for grunt-wordpress are installed in WordPress.
